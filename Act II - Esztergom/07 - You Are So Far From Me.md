**STEPHEN**  
Oh, my good Lord, Jesus once said: one is lost from sword, when living with sword,  
But in a crossfire, on a crossroad, only a fool may hope for peace.  
Tell me, how much is a human worth, if he is without sins, but is weak?  
Tell me, how much, if preparing for a bloody victory.  

Oh, my good Lord, I don't know anymore, who I shall be loyal to.  
My sword is striking your laws, if I need to kill in order to protect you.  
Tell me, how much is a human worth, if he is without sins, but is weak?  
Tell me, how much, if preparing for a bloody victory.  

You are so far away from me, but also very near.  
I cannot understand you, neither can I reach you.  
You are so far away from me, but also very near.  
Listening, and I feel, my heart is answering.

**STEPHEN** *(REKA)*
Oh, my good Lord, I got my soul and position from you.  
*(Sweet Lord, look down on me,)*  
Enemies standing with me, my people attacking attacking me.  
*(Blossoming flower on the end of your garden.)*  
Tell me, how much is a human worth, if he is without sins, but is weak?  
*(My heart is breaking, when thinking about you,)*  
Tell me, how much, if preparing for a bloody victory.  
*(I would fade away without you.)*

**BOTH**  
You are so far away from me, but also very near.  
I cannot understand you, neither can I reach you.  
You are so far away from me, but also very near.  
Listening, and I feel, my heart is answering.

**REKA**  
Sweet Lord, look down on me,  
Blossoming flower on the end of your garden.  
My heart is breaking, when thinking about you,  
I would fade away without you.
