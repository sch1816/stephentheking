**RÉKA**  
Oh, my God, help us!  
Give comfort to the sufferers!  
Keep the evil away from us!  
Forgive the sinners!  
Be the true, understanding God,  
As your wisdom is infinite.  
Bring peace to us,  
and light to our people!

**LABORC**  
Come to your mind, Koppány's daughter!  
Your father's house is still a proud castle!  
Do not let anyone see you kneeling!  

**RÉKA**  
Oh, my God, forgive us  
that we are not yet worthy of you!  
Be the true, understanding God,  
as there is so much trouble here on Earth.

**LABORC**
Why are you begging like an orphan?  
You are not the daughter of anybody!  
Stand before Koppány, and say  
That the people are suffering.  
Ask your father to help,  
He is a greater lord than the God!  
Soon Koppány will be monarch!

We don't need such God, who forgives everything.  
We don't need such God, who kills one of his sons.  
We don't need such God, who can't speak Hungarian.  
Free Hungarians don't need such lord!

We don't need such God, who think whoever lives, is guilty  
We don't need such God, who promises only suffering  
We don't need such God, who can't speak Hungarian.  
Free Hungarians don't need such lord!

Don't need, don't need!  
Don't need, don't need!  
Don't need, don't need!  
Don't need, don't need!  

**CROWD**  
Don't need, don't need!  
Don't need, don't need!  
Don't need, don't need!  
Don't need, don't need!
