**REKA**
My Good Father, I have dreamt last night,  
I saw you at the peak of the four biggest castles,  
The sky went dark, and many daughters became orphans.  
Those who use a sword, all die from a sword.  
Be a wise leader, and chase away the ancient curses.  
Seek for peace, since there were already many victims.
