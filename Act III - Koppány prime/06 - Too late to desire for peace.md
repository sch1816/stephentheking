**REKA**
My Good Father, I have dreamt last night,  
I saw you at the peak of the four biggest castles,  
The sky went dark, and many daughters became orphans.  
Those who grab a sword, all die from a sword.  
Be a wise leader, and chase away the ancient curses.  
Seek for peace, since there were already many victims.  

**KOPPANY**
There's no way back,  
'Cause Stephen is already preparing for the fight.  
He calls in foreigners to help against Hungarians.  
I'm considered as a pagan though I've taken the sign of Byzantium on myself,  
The only aim was, to conserve our freedom.  
I'm considered as a pagan, 'cause I can't bear the power of priests,  
They call out for sin, where the country defends its freedom.  
I'm considered as a pagan, 'cause I resist the conquerors,  
Everybody is a pagan here who is with me instead of Stephen.
