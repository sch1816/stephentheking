**REKA**  
My Good Father, I have dreamt last night,  
I saw you at the peak of the four biggest castles,  
The sky went dark, and many daughters became orphans.  
Those who grab a sword, all die from a sword.  
Be a wise leader, and chase away the ancient curses.  
Seek for peace, since there were already many victims.  

**KOPPANY**  
There's no way back,  
'Cause Stephen is already preparing for the fight.  
He calls in foreigners to help against Hungarians.  
I'm considered as a pagan though I've taken the sign of Byzantium on myself,  
The only aim was, to conserve our freedom.  
I'm considered as a pagan, 'cause I can't bear the power of priests,  
They call out for sin, where the country defends its freedom.  
I'm considered as a pagan, 'cause I resist the conquerors,  
Everybody is a pagan here who is with me instead of Stephen.  

It is too late to reconsider everything,  
Late to desire peace.  
Too late for the past to reinterpret,  
The world is on an orbit of constraints!  

**STEPHEN**  
Chief Kopp√°ny, don't think that I don't love you.  
The throne is yours, if you accept what you have to do.  
The fate of the folk and country is in our hands,
All roads lead to Rome, or to devastation.  

**KOPPANY**  
I'm considered as a pagan, 'cause I can't bear the power of priests,  
**STEPHEN**  
Accept Rome, and from tomorrow the country is yours  
**KOPPANY**  
I'm considered as a pagan, 'cause I resist the conquerors,  
**STEPHEN**  
I've brought peace, 'cause peace is what the country needs.  

**KOPPANY**  
It is too late to reconsider everything,  
Late to desire peace.  
Too late for the past to reinterpret,  
The world is on an orbit of constraints!
