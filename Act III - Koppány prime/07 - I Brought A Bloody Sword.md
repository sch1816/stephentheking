I brought a bloody sword,
The bloody sword of our ancestors,
The folks are ready for a fate-changing battle!

We defend our freedom,
Stand against Stephen,
We don't need the pale deity.

Free folks of Árpád,
Blood of the conquerors,
Do not bear foreign chains!

Our dreams come true,
Or we are lost til the last,
But better dead, than servants!
