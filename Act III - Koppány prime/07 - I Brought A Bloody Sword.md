I brought a bloody sword,  
The bloody sword of our ancestors,  
The folks are ready for a fate-changing battle!

We defend our freedom,  
Stand against Stephen,  
We don't need the pale deity.

Free folks of Árpád,  
Blood of the conquerors,  
Do not bear foreign chains!

Our dreams come true,  
Or we are lost til the last,  
But better dead, than servants!

*Koppany, Koppany,*  
*Koppany, Koppany,*  
*Koppany, Koppany,*  
*Koppany, Koppany!*

Koppany, if you defeat Stephen,  
The heroes don't stop coming,  
The folk will be really great!

From Rome to the Greek-Byzantine,  
From the Rhine to Levedia,  
The name of your descendants will be feared.

We are going to win at Mohacs,  
Dozsa is going to be King George,  
Great power through many centuries.  

Rakoczi is going to conquer the world,  
The Republic of Danube will come  
to reality with Kossuth!  

*Koppany, Koppany,*  
*Koppany, Koppany,*  
*Koppany, Koppany,*  
*Koppany, Koppany!*
