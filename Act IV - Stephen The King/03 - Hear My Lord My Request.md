**REKA**  
You have won my lord against my father,
Who stirred a dark storm against you.
Light and glory is your name,
But don't hate the beaten.

Hear my Lord my request,
My dead father give out for me 
Let me bury him into the ground,
Let him rest in peace.

Be our true and understanding lord,
When in this world we are servants of yours.
Give solace to the suffering,
Forgive to the sinners.

**STEPHEN**
