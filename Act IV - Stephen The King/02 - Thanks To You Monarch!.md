**THREE LORDS** 
Long live Stephen, the wise and the fair,
Long live Stephen, the Monarch! (Monarch!)
Long live Stephen, who won over the evil,
Thanks to you, Monarch! (Monarch!)

Hail! Hail! Hail!

**SOLDIERS AND KNIGHTS**
The army of Kopp√°ny was beaten by ours,
There's no more pagan who resists us
Just call our good Lord, we'll always help
We don't ask more, only what we can for

**KNIGHT**
Wise knight, defends his castle, fears no one,
In the fight he is always the first, invincibly!

**STEPHEN**
I understand it, knight!

**CROWD CHEERING**
Hail! Hail! Hail!
